(autoload 'el-patch-validate "el-patch" "\
Validate the patch given by PATCH-DEFINITION.
This means el-patch will attempt to find the original definition
for the function, and verify that it is the same as the original
function assumed by the patch. A warning will be signaled if the
original definition for a patched function cannot be found, or if
there is a difference between the actual and expected original
definitions.

Interactively, use `completing-read' to select a function to
inspect the patch of.

PATCH-DEFINITION is a list beginning with `defun', `defmacro',
etc.

Returns nil if the patch is not valid, and otherwise returns t.
If NOMSG is non-nil, does not signal a message when the patch is
valid.

If RUN-HOOKS is non-nil, runs `el-patch-pre-validate-hook' and
`el-patch-post-validate-hook'. Interactively, this happens unless
a prefix argument is provided.

See also `el-patch-validate-all'.
